- 👋 Hi, I’m @Goldside543!
- 💻 My OS was Windows 11, but I now use Arch Linux!
- 🛠️ I'm currently working on what I call Virtux, a version of the Linux kernel made for hosting virtual machines. (but it's driving me insane, the kernel takes a million years to compile, and one mistake sets me back by over a day) I'm also working on Goldspace, a kernel I'm developing.
